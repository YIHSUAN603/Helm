# Helm

A terminal that watches your AI coding agents for you.

## What Helm does

Helm is a desktop terminal app. Each tab is a real shell session — but when
you run an AI coding agent like Claude Code or Codex in one, Helm watches
its output and tells you what it's doing: thinking, running a tool, waiting
for your approval, done, or stuck on an error. Pending approvals, running
cost, and files an agent has changed are all surfaced in one place, so you
can run several agents side by side without babysitting each terminal
individually.

## Installing

Download the installer for your platform from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/YIHSUAN603/Helm/releases). Helm
checks for updates automatically every time it starts and installs them in
the background — there's nothing to do manually.

Prefer to build it yourself? See [Building from source](#building-from-source)
below.

## Getting started

1. Helm opens with one empty session ready to go.
2. Click **+** next to a workspace to start a new session, and choose what
   to launch: **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Shell** (a plain terminal, no
   agent detection), or any custom agent you've added.
3. Use it like a normal terminal — everything you type goes straight to the
   real shell.
4. When the agent needs your input, Helm shows an **approval prompt**
   automatically with **Approve**/**Reject** buttons (or the shortcuts
   `Ctrl+A y` / `Ctrl+A N`) — no need to switch to that tab and read its
   output yourself.

## Organizing sessions

The sidebar has two levels: **workspaces** (groups) containing **sessions**
(individual terminals).

- **New workspace** — click **+** in the sidebar header; it's ready for you
  to name right away.
- **Rename a workspace** — double-click its header, or select it and press
  `F2`.
- **Delete a workspace** — hover its header and click the **×**; its
  sessions move to the default workspace (which can't be deleted).
- **Collapse/expand** — click the header or its chevron.
- **Set a default folder** — hover the workspace and click **📁** to pick a
  folder; new sessions started in that workspace open there. The chosen path
  is shown under the header — hover it and click **×** to clear. A workspace
  without a folder falls back to the default working directory in Settings.
- **New session in a workspace** — hover the workspace and click its **+**.
- **Move a session** — drag it onto another workspace (even a collapsed
  one) to drop it there.
- **Close a session** — click its **×**, or select it and press
  `Delete`/`Backspace`.

Each session shows a status dot (thinking, running, awaiting approval, done,
error — or idle/running/exited for a plain shell) plus an agent badge if
one is running. A workspace you're not currently viewing shows a badge with
its pending-approval count — click it to jump straight to that approval.

## Split groups

Each session controls its own layout. A session normally fills the whole
screen; splitting it creates a new session next to it and the two form a
**split group** — switching to any member of the group shows the whole
group's layout, while sessions outside it still show fullscreen. When a
group is down to one pane it dissolves and that session goes back to
fullscreen.

- **Split a pane** — use the ◫ (split right) / ⊟ (split down) buttons on a
  pane's title bar, or `Ctrl+A %` (right) and `Ctrl+A "` (down), just like
  tmux. Right-click a split button (or use the Command Palette) to choose
  which agent to launch in the new pane instead of a plain shell.
- **Close a pane** — the **×** on its title bar, or `Ctrl+A x`.
- **Resize** — drag the divider between panes (double-click a divider to
  reset it to 50/50), or `Ctrl+A Ctrl+arrow` to resize the focused pane in
  small steps.
- **Move focus between panes** — `Ctrl+A arrow`, or `Ctrl+A o` to cycle to
  the next one.

## Keeping track of your agents

- **Approval panel** — pops up automatically whenever an agent in your
  current workspace is waiting on you. Shows the agent, the session, and
  its actual question, with Approve/Reject per session and Approve
  All/Reject All when more than one is waiting. If the same prompt keeps
  reappearing after you respond, Helm will tell you the automated
  keystrokes may not match that agent — reply directly in the terminal
  instead.
- **Cost and tokens** — the toolbar shows the active session's running cost
  and input/output token counts, plus a workspace-wide total (Σ).
- **Changed files** — click the toolbar's file-count button (or
  `Ctrl+A f`) to see every file an agent has touched in the current
  workspace, grouped by session.

## Agent integrations (optional, recommended)

Out of the box Helm detects an agent's state by reading what's on screen,
which can lag or misread when an agent's UI changes between versions.
Claude Code and Codex also provide official channels, and Helm can use
them for instant, precise detection:

- **Claude Code hooks** — open Settings → **Agent integrations** and click
  **Install**. This adds a small forwarding hook to
  `~/.claude/settings.json`, so Claude Code itself tells Helm the moment it
  needs approval (including the exact command or file), when a turn ends,
  and which files changed. Outside Helm the hook does nothing.
- **Claude Code statusline** — a separate opt-in install that also reports
  live cost and remaining context. If you already have a custom statusline,
  Helm won't touch it.
- **Codex notifications** — Codex can emit desktop-notification escape
  codes that Helm reads directly. Copy the two-line snippet shown in
  Settings into the `[tui]` section of `~/.codex/config.toml`.

Screen reading stays on as a fallback, so everything keeps working if you
skip this — approvals just take a moment longer to detect.

## Broadcasting to multiple agents

Type a message once in the toolbar's broadcast box, choose whether it goes
to **agents only** or **every session** currently visible on screen (the
active split group, or just the active session when it's fullscreen), and
press Enter (or Send, or `Ctrl+A b` to jump to the box) — it's typed
into all of them at once. Handy for answering the same question across
several agents in one go.

## Command Palette

Press `Ctrl/⌘+Shift+P` to open a searchable list of everything Helm can do
— split panes, start a session with a specific agent, toggle the theme,
approve/reject, open Settings, jump to a session, and more — each shown
with its keyboard shortcut. Type to filter, arrow keys plus Enter to run.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Helm uses **tmux-style prefix shortcuts**: press `Ctrl+A` (the prefix —
literally Ctrl, on every platform including macOS), then a second key. While
the prefix is active a hint panel lists every available key; press `Esc`
(or wait a moment) to cancel. An unknown second key is swallowed, never
typed into the terminal.

Because the shell itself uses Ctrl+A for "beginning of line", press
`Ctrl+A a` (or `Ctrl+A Ctrl+A`) to send a literal Ctrl+A through to the
terminal.

**Sessions** — after `Ctrl+A`, press:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | New session |
| `n` / `p` | Next / previous session |
| `1` … `9` | Jump to session 1–9 |
| `w` | New workspace |

**Panes & split groups** — after `Ctrl+A`, press:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `%` | Split pane right |
| `"` | Split pane down |
| `x` | Close focused pane |
| `o` | Focus next pane |
| `arrow` | Move focus between panes |
| `Ctrl+arrow` | Resize the focused pane |

**Approvals** — after `Ctrl+A`, press:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `y` | Approve the active session's prompt |
| `N` (`Shift+n`) | Reject the active session's prompt |

**Other** — after `Ctrl+A`, press:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `f` | Toggle changed-files panel |
| `t` | Toggle light/dark theme |
| `s` | Open Settings |
| `b` | Focus the broadcast box |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus between UI regions forward/back |
| `a` or `Ctrl+A` | Send a literal Ctrl+A to the terminal |

The one direct (non-prefix) shortcut is `Ctrl/⌘+Shift+P` — open the
Command Palette (Ctrl on Windows/Linux, ⌘ on macOS).

## Settings

Open Settings from the gear icon at the bottom of the sidebar. Everything
here applies immediately and is remembered for next time:

- **Theme** — 10 presets (Dark, Light, Solarized Dark, Nord, Dracula,
  Gruvbox Dark, One Dark, Tokyo Night, GitHub Dark, GitHub Light)
- **Language** — English or Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
- **Font family** and **font size** (8–32)
- **Cursor style** (block, bar, underline) and **cursor blink**
- **Default shell** and **default working directory** for new sessions
  (leave blank to use your system's defaults)
- **Agent integrations** — one-click setup for the official Claude Code /
  Codex signals (see [Agent integrations](#agent-integrations-optional-recommended))
- Installed app version and current update status

## Supported agents & customization

Helm recognizes **Claude Code** and **Codex** out of the box. To add
support for another CLI agent (or customize how approvals are detected),
create or edit an `agents.json` file in Helm's config directory — no code
required, just describes how to recognize the tool and its states.
